Pymaceuticals Inc., a hypothetical pharmaceutical company specializes in anti-cancer treatment. In their most recent efforts, they've begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. This project aims to analyze a set of animal study data to show how four experimental drugs (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare. 

In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time.
